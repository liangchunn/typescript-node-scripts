Ready to create an application?

Make sure that your Node version is at least `8.x`. You can run the command below to check if your version of Node is compatible with typescript-node-scripts:

```sh
node --version
```

To create an application, run the following below:

```sh
npx typescript-node-scripts create <my_app>
```

After the command has run, you will find the folder `<my_app>` in your current directory. To get started right away and run the development server, run the following:

```sh
# go into the folder
cd <my_app>

# start the dev server
yarn start
```
